# News Web App

# Description

The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. You have a login/signup page using which you can create an account in this web app. The home page list out the latest news, and you could also save some of the feed for read later purpose. The app also contains a side filter which can be used to filter out the news based on category. The user also has access to the profile section where he can edit his credentials and also delete the account.
